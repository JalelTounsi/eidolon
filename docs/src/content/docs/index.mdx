## Why Eidolon?
#### 1. Easy to Deploy
With Eidolon, agents are services, so there is no extra work when it comes time to deploy. The HTTP server is built in.
#### 2. Simple Agent-to-Agent Communication
Since agents are services with well-defined interfaces, they easily communicate with tools dynamically generated from the openapi json schema defined by the agent services.
#### 3. Painless Component Customization and Upgrade
With a focus on modularity, Eidolon makes it easy to swap out components. Grab an off the shelf llm, rag impl, tools, etc or just define your own.

This means no vendor lock-in and minimizes the work needed to upgrade portions of an agent. Without this flexibility, developers will not be able to adapt their agents to the rapidly changing AI landscape.
