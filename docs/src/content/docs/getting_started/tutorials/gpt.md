## Want to make a GPT in Eidolon?

Eidolon can do a lot of things, but sometimes the best way to learn is to start with a simple example.

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of building a simple conversational agent using the Eidolon framework. This agent will be capable of understanding and responding to user inputs in a conversational manner, similar to GPTs you may be familiar with.
